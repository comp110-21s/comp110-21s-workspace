    "## Part 10. Overloading the Subscription Notation to Filter with a Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "The acclaimed _NumPy_ library, that `Simpy` is inspired by, allows you to use the subscription operator not just to select individual items, but also to filter with a mask. It adds a second usage to the operator, just like you have had two uses of many of the operators above, such as adding two `Simpy`s or a `Simpy` and a `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea of the second usage of subscription notation is that if instead of giving an `int` inside the subscription brackets you give a `list[bool]`, the expression will return a new `Simpy` object containing only the _masked_, or filtered, `values`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "a = Simpy([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0])\n",
    "mask = a > 2.0\n",
    "print(mask)  # Output: [False, False, True, True, False, False]\n",
    "b = a[mask]\n",
    "print(b) # Output: Simpy([3.0, 4.0])  \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example did not need to establish a separate variable named `mask`, it only did so to make it obvious what the `mask` values were. More conventionally, the above example would be written in a shorter-form notation such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "a = Simpy([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0])\n",
    "b = a[a > 2.0]\n",
    "print(b) # Output: Simpy([3.0, 4.0])\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to reflect on how _expressive_ that second line is! For this expression to evaluate, first the `__gt__` method call must evaluate and finally a `__getitem__` method call whose behavior you will need to extend. Notice how natural this expression feels in English: from the `Simpy` object `a`, select the values that greater than `2.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these two distinct use cases, notice not only the parameter given to `__getitem__` can either be an `int` in the first usage and a `list[bool]` in the second usage, but the return type will also be two different types: either a single `float` value or a new `Simpy` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, you will need to modify the signature of your `__getitem__` method and implement logic to test for whether `rhs` is an instance of an `int` or not.\n",
